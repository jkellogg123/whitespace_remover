## Introduction
Meant to be used for a CLI command. It should take a supported code file type (e.g. .cpp) and remove all unnecessary whitespace.

Will need ***C++20*** to compile (only for std::string.ends_with(), everything else was compilable with C++17)

## Supported file types
1. .cpp / .hpp / .c / .h

## Want to add:
1. .txt
2. .py
3. no one should be using any other file types

## New feature ideas
This section is just to put ideas for new features/changes.

1. Add logic for multiline strings in cpp files
