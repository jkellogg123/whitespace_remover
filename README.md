## Introduction
Meant to be used for a CLI command. It should take a supported code file type (.cpp) and remove all unnecessary whitespace.


## Supported file types
1. .cpp

## To add
1. .txt
2. .py
3. .c (should be same as .cpp?)
4. .h / .hpp (again same as .c / .cpp?)
5. no one should be using any other file types

## New feature ideas
This section is just to put ideas for new features/changes.

1. Add logic for interpretting maintaining string literals.
2. Add option to keep/remove newlines
